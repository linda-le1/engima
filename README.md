# enigma

Functionality - Meets Expectations(3)
Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented.

Object Oriented Programming - Meets Expectations(3)
Project is broken up into an enigma, encryption, decryption, and key_generator class with their own respective responsibilities. No class is over 100 lines (most are around 50 lines) and no more than a few methods are over 7 lines including the def and end lines. Variable and method names provide clarity in regards to purpose.

Test Driven Development - Meets Expectations(3)
Per SimpleCov, test coverage is at 100% with both unit and integration tests for most, if not every class. However, I did have to add a few more tests towards the end to ensure that I covered all of the methods that were created. Stubs/mocks were not utilized.

Version Control - 3.5
51 commits with a total of 16 branches and 20 pull requests. The majority of the PRs are well named and clearly communicate the purpose of the PR. There may be a couple where multiple pieces of functionality were pushed up, but there should be no more than 3.
